### ✅ Step-by-Step Process

#### **Step 1: Ensure You Have a Microsoft Account (MSA)**

> A Microsoft account is required to use Azure DevOps.

* If you already have an email ending in `@outlook.com`, `@hotmail.com`, or `@live.com`, you likely already have an MSA.
* If not, create one by visiting:
  👉 [https://signup.live.com](https://signup.live.com)
* Follow the instructions to register a new account.

#### **Step 2: Go to Azure DevOps**

> Now that you have an MSA, it’s time to visit Azure DevOps.

* Open a browser and go to:
  👉 [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com)

#### **Step 5: Create Your First Project**
